Description: lightweight Wayland compositor
 labwc stands for Lab Wayland Compositor, where lab can mean any of the following:
    * sense of experimentation and treading new ground
    * inspired by BunsenLabs and ArchLabs
    * your favorite pet
 It is a wlroots-based stacking compositor aiming to be lightweight
 and independent, with a focus on simply stacking windows well and
 rendering some window decorations. It relies on clients for wallpaper,
 panels, screenshots, and so on to create a full desktop environment.
